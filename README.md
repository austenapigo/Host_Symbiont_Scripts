# Host Specificity Scripts

High-throughput sequencing has accelerated the rate at which we can characterize host-associated microbial communities and sequencing-based datasets are ever accumulating. However, often times we have little to no information about the ecological or evolutionary context for many of these pairwise interactions. How should we try to make sense of these datasets rich with information about composition and interaction frequency, but (usually) without much else? 

In our most recent pre-print (Apigo and Oono 202X; _____), we propose that host specificity can help fill this gap. Host specificity, or the degree to which symbionts are restricted in a host community, can provide information about the symbiont niche and test hypotheses for the underlying mechanisms that can produce turnover in symbiont communities. Specifically in this study, we use an alternative class of metrics to quantify host specificity (along with commonly-used multivariate techniques; e.g., ordination) to test hypotheses that integrate information about the endophyte lifestyle and features of the plant community that seek to understand general mechanisms that produce host-specific relationships.
