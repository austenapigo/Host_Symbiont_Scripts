### Why use `lotus` and what does it do?

Host-symbiont relationships are ubiquitous throughout the natural world. Yet often times we have little to no information about the ecological or evolutionary context for many of the pairwise interactions between hosts and symbionts. How should we try to make sense of datasets rich with information about composition (taxonomy) and interaction frequency (read counts) but usually not much else? 

We propose that host specificity, or the degree to which symbionts are restricted within a host community, provides a reasonable first step to generate ecological and evolutionary information about the symbiont niche.  We developed this package because we think these metrics are useful, but underutilized, and can be leveraged in many different systems to help answer questions about host specificity. 

**The purpose of `lotus` is to provide functions that:**
1. **Quantify host specificity metrics per symbiont**
2. **Relavitize these metrics to null host specificity models to account for variation in symbiont abundance**
3. **Visualize null expectations to observed host specificities within occupancy-abundance models**

### What are the metrics? 
Host specificity exists on a continuum of phylogenetic, spatial and temporal scales. For example, a given symbiont could be restricted in the number of hosts it associates with whereas another symbiont could be restricted in the phylogenetic or geographic breadth of available hosts. We've further developed a framework originally proposed in host-parasite systems by Poulin et al. (2011) that considers how host specificity can vary in a number of different ways: 
- **Structural specificity** quantifies the most fundamental perspective of host specificity, a symbiont's presence and evenness of abundance among hosts. Structural specificity asks how many hosts does a given symbiont occupy? 
- **Network specificity** quantifies the 'strength' of host-symbiont interactions by accounting for all potential hosts a symbiont could occupy in a host community. Network specificity asks how host-specific is a given symbiont when weighted by all potential interactions that could occur? 
- **Phylogenetic specificity** quantifies host specificity relative to the phylogenetic scale of the hosts in a community. Phylogenetic specificity asks what is the phylogenetic breadth of the hosts that a given symbiont occupies? 
- **Beta-specificity** quantifies host specificity relative to host spatial or temporal scales. Beta-specificity asks how consistent is a given symbiont over a host's geographical range (e.g., across quadrats or sites) or through time (e.g., sampling periods)? 

**For each of these metrics, a narrower symbiont niche indicates higher host specificity.**

We originally described these metrics here: [Apigo and Oono 2018](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-89833-9_2).  
We used these metrics to test hypotheses in a plant-endophyte system with a manuscript that is currently in review (more details on this soon).

However, these metrics are useful for any host-symbiont of choice!** Structural, network, phylogenetic and beta-specificity diagram depicting two endophytes (blue and grey shaded areas) occupying varying plant species (bryophyte, monilophyte, gymnosperm and angiosperm) across two sites (Sites A and B). **Structural specificity** (blue and grey shaded areas within solid lines) quantifies how endophytes vary in presence and evenness on hosts, the most fundamental feature of host-specific interactions. For example, Endophyte 1 (blue shade) occupies fewer plant species in Sites A and B (two plant species per site) relative to Endophyte 2 (four plant species in Site A and five hosts in Site B) and has higher structural specificity. **Phylogenetic specificity** (cladogram) quantifies host specificity in the context of plant evolutionary relatedness. Endophyte 1 occupies a phylogenetically narrower breadth of plant species in Sites A and B (gymnosperms only) relative to Endophyte 2 (angiosperm, bryophyte, gymnosperm and monilophyte) and has higher phylogenetic specificity. **Network specificity** (dashed lines) quantifies the strength of host-specific interactions by accounting for all potential hosts a symbiont could occupy in a host community. Endophyte 1 occupies a lower proportion of plants in Sites A and B (2/4 in Site A and 2/5 in Site B) relative to Endophyte 2 (4/4 in Site A and 5/5 in Site B) and has higher network specificity. In contrast to structural and phylogenetic specificity, **beta-specificity** (arrow between Sites A and B) quantifies how endophytes vary in the consistency of their specificity to plant species by geography (Krasnov et al. 2011) or time (not depicted). Endophyte 1 occupies the same set of hosts in Sites A and B and has higher beta-specificity, whereas Endophyte 2 occupies a more variable set of plant species across Sites A and B.</sup>

### Why do we need null host specificity models? 
Host specificity analyses could be particularly vulnerable to biased inferences by not accounting for relationships between host specificity and symbiont abundance. Rarer symbionts will always have a lower theoretical maximum of the number of hosts they could occupy and are frequently categorized as more host-specific relative to more abundant symbionts. If one didn't account for variation in symbiont read abundance, rare symbionts could be systematically biased to be more host-specific simply because they have a lower probablity of occurring in many hosts relative to more abundant symbionts. The relationship between a symbiont’s host specificity and its abundance is an extension of abundance-occupancy relationships, the widely documented biogeographic pattern in macroecology that predicts a positive relationship between a species abundance and its occurrence across sites. If more abundant symbionts tend to occupy more hosts, there is expected to be a positive relationship between an symbiont’s abundance and its host specificity, or occupancy across plants.

To account for bias that often occurs between symbiont read abundance and observed host specificity, we developed a method that relativized observed host specifities to null expectations. **Relativizing host specificity to null models allows one to ask, how does an observed symbiont's host specificity compare to its expected value under random community assembly?** We propose that this allowed us to compare the host specifities of symbionts that varied widely in read abundance instead of splitting rare vs. abundant symbiont communities at an arbitrary relative abundance threshold (common in other studies) or not accounting for read abundance at all. There's a slight modification of this null model approach for phylogenetic specificity because relationships between phylogenetic specificity and read abundance are usually decreasing-variance (rather than negative) and you can read more about the specifics in the package documentation. 

![Null Model Figure](https://github.com/austenapigo/lotus/blob/master/figures/null_model.png)

<sup>**Conceptual diagram of host specificity metrics relativized by null models.** (A-B) Each shape represents an individual symbiont. Shapes vertically positioned above each other have equal read abundance. Shapes positioned horizontal to each other occupy the same number of plants or have equal uncorrected host specificity values. The null expectation of the relationship between host specificity and read abundance is represented by a theoretical 1:1 relationship based on occupancy-abundance relationships (abundant symbionts likely occupy more plants). Asterisks represent the deviance in observed host specificity from a null model and are equal for all shapes. We describe three scenarios that highlight how null models can account for read abundance variation in host specificity analysis.</sup>

<sup>Scenario 1: Symbionts with different read abundances occupy the same number of plants and thus have the same uncorrected host specificities (green triangle vs. blue circle). The green triangle symbiont occurs in more plants than expected for a rarer symbiont, while the blue triangle occurs in fewer plants than expected for a more abundant symbiont. After relativizing their host specificities to the null model, the green triangle symbiont has lower host specificity and the blue circle has higher host specificity.</sup>

<sup>Scenario 2: Symbionts with the same read abundance occupy different numbers of plants and thus have different uncorrected host specificities (yellow square vs. green triangle or blue circle vs. orange diamond). The yellow square symbiont and the green triangle symbiont occupy either fewer or more plants than expected for symbiont with this read abundance. After relativizing their host specificities to the null model, differences in host specificity remain the same to uncorrected values because they exhibit the same magnitude of deviance from the null expectation.</sup>

<sup>Scenario 3: Symbionts with different read abundances occupy different numbers of plants and thus have different uncorrected host specificities (yellow square vs. orange diamond or yellow square vs. blue circle or green triangle vs. orange diamond). The yellow square symbiont occurs in fewer plants than expected for a rarer symbiont, while the orange diamond symbiont occurs in more plants than expected for a more abundant symbiont. After relativizing their host specificities to the null model, differences in their host specificities are less than their uncorrected host specificities but are equal in magnitude to Scenario 2. These symbionts display the same amount of deviance from a null expectation for symbionts of their given read abundance.</sup>

<sup>(B-D) Host specificity relativized by null models with empirical data. Instead of a theoretical 1:1 null expectation, we calculated null models from randomized communities. We quantified how host specificity of symbionts within randomized communities varied as a function of read abundance. We then relavitized observed symbiont host specificity to null models by taking the difference between an observed symbiont’s host specificity to null expectations. The black line represents a null expectation generated from 100 community randomizations with an inset equation describing its relationship between uncorrected host specificity and symbiont abundance. Red points refer to individual symbionts that occur within a given plant sample, *Galium angustifolium*. The host specificity of its symbionts was calculated as Shannon’s H (structural specificity) across the entire plant community, plotted as a function of log-transformed absolute symbiont read abundance and relativized by the null model. For phylogenetic specificity, differences between observed and null host specificities were divided by the standard deviation of the null model to account for decreasing-variance relationships.</sup>

<sup>We term observed host specificity as “absolute host specificity” because these values are not modified by comparison to a null model. Absolute host specificities are then relativized by the null expectation for a symbiont of a given read abundance to account for the propensity of rarer symbionts to occupy fewer host species that we term “relative host specificity”. Relative host specificity is calculated as as the vertical difference between an symbiont’s absolute host specificity and the null model expectation with respect to read abundance and is averaged symbionts per host. A relative host specificity value greater than zero indicates that an symbiont was more host-specific relative to symbionts with the same read abundances within randomized communities. We advocate that relative host specificities are a better method to classify host-specific interactions because they do so depending on their expectation to occur by chance rather than being biased towards classifying symbionts as host-specific simply because they are rare.</sup>

### Why not use multivariate techniques to evaluate host specificity? 

Contemporary microbial ecology studies almost exclusively infer host specificity by the degree of compositional similarity of symbiont communities per host in multivariate ordination space. Similarity among symbiont communities within each host is ultimately influenced by the degree of niche overlap across all hosts per symbiont. For example, specialist symbionts that are consistently found within the same host species, but not others, should increase compositional similarity within the same host species and increase dissimilarity among different host species. Few studies utilize multivariate approaches in tandem with univariate approaches measured per symbiont (e.g., the number of host species a symbiont occupies), perhaps because they are assumed to be correlated, but whether it's the **best and only tool** for every question related to host specificity is still an open question. Metrics calculated per symbiont can tell you more about *why* clustering in ordination space occurs (or does not occur) and can give a more transparent view of how symbionts vary in their host specificity.
